This repo contains the [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) and [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) configurations for my workstations and servers.

NixOS and Home Manager allow me to declaratively configure my machines - enabling reusable and reproducible configurations, and easy rollbacks.
